# Air-O-Grade

• Led a cooperative team effort to successfully implement an AI and ML project (Air-O-Grade) on Microsoft Azure.

• Project aimed at predicting concentrations of harmful gases (CO, NO2, NMHC’s) using automated ML, pipelines,
and Python programming. Achieved an impressive overall accuracy of 95% with the predictive model.

• Demonstrated the project’s success through engaging presentations to industry experts, professors, and students,
showcasing effective communication and presentation abilities. The presentations were well-received by an audience of 200+ attendees, 
further emphasizing the project’s impact and reach.

Air-O-Grade (Group Project) | Python, Microsoft Azure 

• Implemented pipelines for data cleaning using clip value component, ensuring dataset quality by handling null values.

• Assisted in designing a automated ML model for predicting Non-Methane Hydrocarbons concentration. Applied
regression techniques and conducted model evaluations to identify the most effective algorithm.

• Contributed to team effort in developing pipelines for a Decision Forest Regression model predicting CO
concentrations. Executed model scoring and evaluation employing metrics such as Mean Squared Error and other
parameters.

• Gained insights into modeling decision tree regression and linear regression in Python.
